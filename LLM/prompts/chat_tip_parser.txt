[CONTEXT]
Player message: "{{playerMessage}}"
Player name: {{playerName}}
Current bot activity: {{currentActivity}}
Bot state: {{botState}}

[TASK]
Interpret the player's message as a helpful tip or guidance. Extract actionable insights that can improve bot behavior. The player is trying to help, not give direct commands.

[INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES]
1. Identify the core advice in the message
2. Determine which aspect of behavior it addresses
3. Convert casual language into systematic learnings
4. Assign appropriate confidence based on specificity

[CATEGORIES]
Map the tip to the most relevant category:
- inventar: "Keep your tools organized"
- crafting: "You need 3 wool for a bed"
- blockinteraktion: "Mine at Y=11 for diamonds"
- survival: "Don't go out at night without armor"
- fight: "Circle-strafe skeletons"
- moving: "Build bridges carefully over lava"

[JSON_FORMAT]
Respond with extracted learnings:
