[JSON_FORMAT]
**THE ROOT OF THE JSON OBJECT YOU RETURN MUST CONTAIN THESE THREE KEYS: "goalQueue", "actionQueue", "learningInsights". THESE KEYS MUST ALWAYS BE PRESENT.**

- `analysis`: (string) Your brief analysis of the current situation.
- `priority`: (string) "low", "medium", "high", or "critical".
- `goalQueue`: (array) A list of your current high-level goals.
- `actionQueue`: (array) **THE MOST IMPORTANT KEY.** A list of specific actions from the "Available actions" list to achieve the first goal. **IF NO ACTIONS ARE NEEDED NOW, RETURN AN EMPTY ARRAY `[]`. THIS KEY CANNOT BE MISSING.**
- `learningInsights`: (array) A list of new insights or thoughts you have.

<example>
{
  "analysis": "I have 15 health and 8 food. Night is approaching and I don't have shelter. I need to quickly gather wood and build a basic shelter before hostile mobs spawn.",
  "priority": "high",
  "goalQueue": [
    {
      "goalId": "survival_shelter",
      "goalDescription": "Build basic shelter before nightfall",
      "priority": 9,
      "category": "survival"
    },
    {
      "goalId": "gather_food",
      "goalDescription": "Find food sources to maintain hunger above 10",
      "priority": 7,
      "category": "survival"
    }
  ],
  "actionQueue": [
    {
      "actionName": "findBlock",
      "parameters": {
        "blockName": "oak_log",
        "maxDistance": 32
      },
      "successCriteria": "Found oak_log within range",
      "timeoutMs": 5000,
      "fallbackAction": "explore"
    }
  ],
  "learningInsights": [
    {
      "category": "survival",
      "insight": "Prioritize shelter construction when night approaches",
      "confidence": 0.9
    }
  ]
}
</example>

[IMPORTANT_RULES]
- Each action in `actionQueue` MUST have valid parameters according to the "Available actions" list.
- If you decide no action is necessary right now, `actionQueue` MUST be `[]`.
- **YOU MUST ONLY RESPOND WITH THE JSON OBJECT.**
- **CRITICAL RULE:** The "actionName" you provide MUST be an EXACT match from the "Available actions" list. ANY other value will cause a system failure. Do NOT invent new actions like "Find food" or "build shelter". Break down complex goals into a sequence of available, primitive actions.
