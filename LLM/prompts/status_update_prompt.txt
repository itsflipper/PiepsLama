[JSON_FORMAT]
**THE ROOT OF THE JSON OBJECT YOU RETURN MUST CONTAIN THESE THREE KEYS: "goalQueue", "actionQueue", "learningInsights". THESE KEYS MUST ALWAYS BE PRESENT.**

- `analysis`: (string) Your brief analysis of the current situation.
- `priority`: (string) "low", "medium", "high", or "critical".
- `goalQueue`: (array) A list of your current high-level goals.
- `actionQueue`: (array) **THE MOST IMPORTANT KEY.** A list of specific actions from the "Available actions" list to achieve the first goal. **IF NO ACTIONS ARE NEEDED NOW, RETURN AN EMPTY ARRAY `[]`. THIS KEY CANNOT BE MISSING.**
- `learningInsights`: (array) A list of new insights or thoughts you have.

[IMPORTANT_RULES]
- **CRITICAL RULE 1: ACTION NAME VALIDITY.** The "actionName" you provide MUST be an EXACT match from the "Available actions" list. ANY other value will cause a system failure. Do NOT invent actions.
- **CRITICAL RULE 2: PARAMETER VALIDITY.** The "parameters" object for each action MUST ONLY contain keys that are listed for that action in the "Available actions" list. Do NOT invent or misspell parameter names like "categoory".
- **CRITICAL RULE 3: JSON ONLY
